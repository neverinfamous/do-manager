- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability
- Your suggestions for fixing it (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

### Security Update Process

1. **Validation**: We'll confirm the vulnerability
2. **Fix Development**: We'll work on a patch
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of the fix
4. **Disclosure**: 
   - We'll coordinate disclosure with you
   - Security advisory published
   - Release with fix deployed
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Durable Objects Manager:

### Authentication

- **Always use Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust)** in production
- Configure appropriate identity providers (GitHub OAuth, etc.)
- Set restrictive access policies
- Never disable authentication checks
- Ensure WebSocket connections are properly authenticated

### API Security

- **Protect API tokens**: Never commit tokens to version control
- Use Cloudflare Workers Secrets for sensitive data
- Set proper CORS policies
- Implement rate limiting if needed
- Validate all inputs, especially Object IDs and Namespaces

### Durable Objects Access

- Grant minimal permissions needed
- Use separate namespaces for different environments (dev/prod)
- Monitor object creation and deletion events
- Audit storage usage logs

### Environment Configuration

- Use `.env` files for local development only
- Never expose Worker secrets
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review Cloudflare Access logs regularly

### Worker Security

```bash
# Set all secrets (never hardcode)
npx wrangler secret put ACCOUNT_ID
npx wrangler secret put API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put TEAM_DOMAIN
npx wrangler secret put POLICY_AUD
```

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS only (enforced by Cloudflare Workers)
- Configure appropriate CSP headers
- Enable Cloudflare's security features
- Monitor for suspicious WebSocket activity

## Known Security Considerations

### Local Development Mode

- Mock data mode bypasses authentication for `localhost`
- **Never deploy** with `VITE_WORKER_API=http://localhost:8787`
- Ensure environment is properly configured for production

### API Token Permissions

- Worker requires **Durable Objects** read/write permission
- Avoid using Global API Key (use scoped API tokens)
- Review token access logs in Cloudflare dashboard

### Data Exposure

- Be cautious with sensitive data in DO storage
- Use Cloudflare Access policies to restrict users
- Consider additional encryption for sensitive fields
- Review operation history for potential data leaks

## Security Features

Durable Objects Manager implements several security features:

- **Cloudflare Access Integration**: Enterprise-grade authentication
- **JWT Validation**: Every API request and WebSocket connection validated
- **Scoped Permissions**: Minimal required access
- **Namespace Isolation**: Strict logical separation of data
- **Audit Logging**: Operation history tracking
- **Secure Defaults**: Production-ready configuration
- **Input Validation**: ID and payload verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Via Cloudflare Workers platform

## Compliance

This project follows:

- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Cloudflare security best practices
- Zero Trust security model
- Principle of least privilege

## Addressed Vulnerabilities

### CVE-2025-64756: glob CLI Command Injection (December 2025)

**Status**: ✅ Mitigated (Proactive Fix)

**Severity**: High

**Description**: The `glob` npm package (versions 10.2.0-10.4.x and 11.0.0-11.0.3) contained a command injection vulnerability in its CLI's `-c/--cmd` option. Malicious filenames with shell metacharacters could execute arbitrary commands when processed.

**Impact on DO Manager**: 
- DO Manager does not directly use the glob CLI
- No current dependencies use vulnerable glob versions
- Risk was theoretical/future-facing

**Mitigation**: 
- Added `"glob": "^11.1.0"` to `package.json` overrides section
- Forces all dependencies (current and future) to use patched version 11.1.0
- Provides defense-in-depth protection against transitive dependencies

- [GitHub Advisory GHSA-xj72-wvfv-8985](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xj72-wvfv-8985)
- [CVE-2025-64756](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64756)

**Verification**:
```bash
# Verify no vulnerable glob versions in dependency tree
npm ls glob --all
```
