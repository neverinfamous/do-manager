## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Automated Database Migrations
- **In-App Migrations**: New visual banner prompts for database upgrades when schema changes are detected.
- **One-Click Upgrade**: Apply all pending migrations safely with a single click.
- **Version Tracking**: System now tracks schema versions to ensure data integrity.
- **Legacy Support**: Automatically detects and marks existing deployments as "legacy" to bridge the gap.

### 🏷️ Instance Tags & Organization
- **Custom Tags**: Add freeform tags (e.g., `env:production`, `team:backend`) to any instance.
- **Tag Search**: Dedicated search tab to find instances by tag across ALL namespaces.
- **Namespace Colors**: Assign color tags to namespaces (similar to instances) for better visual distinction in Grid and List views.
- **Expanded Palette**: Color picker upgraded to 27+ grouped colors.

### ⚡ Search & Performance
- **Optimized Global Search**: Search backends now use parallel query execution and upfront indexing for lightning-fast results.
- **Frontend Caching**: Implemented a smart caching layer with 5-minute TTL to minimize API calls and load times.
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Main bundle cut by nearly half (702 KB → 364 KB) via code splitting and lazy loading of heavy components.

### 🛠️ Enhanced Management Tools
- **Deep Clone Namespace**: Option to clone a namespace AND all its instances + storage data (atomic 2-phase process).
- **List/Grid View Toggle**: Toggle between card grid and sortable table list views for both Namespaces and Instances.
- **Instance Renaming**: Directly rename instances from the list view.
- **SQL Console V2**: Rich editor with syntax highlighting, auto-complete, query formatting, and "Quick Queries" templates.
- **JSON Paste Import**: Paste JSON directly into the Import dialog instead of requiring a file upload.

### 📊 Dashboard & Analytics
- **Instance Counts**: Now displaying the number of instances per namespace in the dashboard.
- **Dashboard Shortcuts**: Added Cloudflare Dashboard icon-link for quick access to the Durable Objects panel.

## 🏗️ Code Quality & Reliability

### 🛡️ Type Safety & Linting
- **Strict TypeScript**: Enabled all strict type-checking options (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, etc.).
- **Strict ESLint**: Adopted `strictTypeChecked` and `stylisticTypeChecked` rulesets for maximum code robustness.

### 📝 Centralized Logging
- **Structured Error Logging**: Replaced ad-hoc console logs with a centralized `error-logger` system.
- **Context-Rich Logs**: Errors now include module codes (`NS`, `INST`, etc.), severity levels, and stack traces.
- **Webhook Integration**: Critical errors and job failures automatically trigger webhooks.

### 🧪 Improvements
- **Rate Limit Protection**: Added exponential backoff retry logic for API calls.
- **Test Coverage**: Expanded validation and error handling across 14 API services.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
